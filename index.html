<!-- What is Redux?
State management library for JS apps
-->

<!-- Where is state stored?
  All state management is stored inside of a central repository 
  (almost like a database for the front end) JS object called the "Store"
  - object is the single source of truth for the application state
  - accessible at all parts of the UI

  You cannot directly modify or mutate the store because Redux is built on top of functional programming principles (in fp you cannot mutate state)
-->

<!-- In summary - 
  Redux centralizes application's state
  Makes data flow transparent and predictable
-->

<!-- Pros & Cons
Time travel debugging - jumping back the previous action and restpre the UI in that state
Log Rocket- tool that allows you to load the application in the same state as the users
Allows you to cache or preserve page state- 

Pros
- Predictable state changes
-Centralized state
-Easy debugging
-Preserve page state
-Undo/redo
- Ecosystem of addons

Cons
Complexity - based on functional programming principles
Verbose - you need boiler plate code to get things done
